distributed-chess
=================

The plan is to create an online chess which only consists of one game at a time. The players are divided into two teams and will vote on the best move to make each turn. They will only have a limited time to do so. Chaos ensues.

(Discuss game design on the github wiki)

Rules (subject to change): 
* You will have a slight delay in voting (as to avoid spamming one vote).
* The vote will NOT be reset after the turn is over.
* The move that wins will be reset down to 0 votes.
* Any illegal move that wins will be reset down to 0 votes, and a new one will be selected.
* Voting will be done through commands in chat.

Still under construction...
